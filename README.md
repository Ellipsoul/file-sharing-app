I wanted to build this project using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and further expand my knowledge to another technology. However, I went looking through my older React projects and the code looked like hieroglyphics to me :(. This project served as a refreshed for my React and NextJS knowledge.
